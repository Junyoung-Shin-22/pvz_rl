Plants vs. Zombies remake and RL agents

## Requirements

The following python libraries are required: pytorch, gym, pygame (and shap to evaluate feature importance if wanted).

## Installation/Setup

The game engine we developped and the Open AI gym environment are both encapsulated in python libraries.

```
git clone https://github.com/inf581-pvz-anonymous/pvz_rl.git
cd pvz
pip install -e .
cd ..
cd gym-pvz
pip install -e .
```

## Usage example

### Train an agent
- plot the learning curves

### Evaluate the agent

### Visualize a play

### Feature importance
